Title: Task 2 - Logic-based Tasks

Objective
The objective of this task is to get you familiarised with common JS array methods, object methods as well as other related concepts. It will have different scenarios for you to plan and implement a solution.

The task requires you to read the problem statement and then come up with a solution to the problem:
Given an array with elements: 3, 56, 23, 78, 23, 78, 100, 123, 148, 193, 190, -190, 210, 34, 67, 3, 78, 210, 34, 34, 50, 59, 89, 87, 230, 210, 100, 23, 980
Sort the numbers from lowest to highest
Sort the numbers from highest to lowest
Return an array of unique numbers. If a number is repeated, it should not occur twice in the returned array.
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the array referred to in the problem statement
Return a new array with elements that are less than or equal to 100
Return a new array with elements that are greater than 50
Return a new array with elements that are divisible by 2
Return a new array with elements that are divisible by 3
Return a new array with elements that are neither divisible by 2 or 3, if they exist. Otherwise return an empty array.
Declare a variable that counts how many elements are in the original array
Declare a new array that contains the same elements as the original array, but reversed. The array should start at 980 and end at 3.
